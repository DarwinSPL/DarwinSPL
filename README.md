# DarwinSPL
DarwinSPL is a software project to model evolving context-aware software product lines.

It strongly depends on DeltaEcore (www.deltaecore.org) which is necessary to run DarwinSPL.

Prerequisites:
- Eclipse (e.g. Eclipse for Java and DSL Developers); Probably not fully working with Neon. So Mars is recommended
   - if you use Neon, you will have to adapt some code pieces generated by EMFText. In particular, an error marker will appear at a wildcard type. change it from "?" to "? super String"
- EMF Validation Framework (using your ecplise's update site - e.g. for neon: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon)
- EMF Comparison (using your ecplise's update site - e.g. for neon: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon)
- EMFText version from DarwinSPL repository (Copy&Paste into your eclipse folder)
- DeltaEcore (installation: http://deltaecore.org/?page_id=68 )

Installation:
- Create Model Code for each *.genmodel file.
- Generate TextResources of all *.cs file (currently only possible if using the EMFText version of the DarwinSPL repository due to a bug in newer versions)

ATTENTION (if you want to use the integrated webservers or the reconfiguration engine HyVarRec https://github.com/HyVar/hyvar-rec):

In eu.hyvar.feature.graphical.configurator.editor and eu.hyvar.reconfigurator.input.rest.dummyclient, you have to ensure that the jetty client version in the build path matches _exactly_ the jetty version of your eclipse installation. If it is not matching, you have to add it to the "lib" folder, replace it in the build path of the project and replace it in the "Classpath" in the "Runtime" tab of the Manifest.MF.
