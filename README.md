# DarwinSPL
DarwinSPL is a software project to model evolving context-aware software product lines.

It strongly depends on DeltaEcore (www.deltaecore.org) which is necessary to run DarwinSPL.

Prerequisites:
- Eclipse (e.g. Eclipse for Java and DSL Developers); Probably not fully working with Neon. So Mars is recommended
- EMFText Nightly
- DeltaEcore

Installation:
- Create Model Code for each *.genmodel file.
- Generate TextResources of all *.cs file (currently not necessary or possible due to a EMFText bug)
