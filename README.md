# DarwinSPL
DarwinSPL is a software project to model evolving context-aware software product lines.

It strongly depends on DeltaEcore (www.deltaecore.org) which is necessary to run DarwinSPL.

Prerequisites:
- EMFText Nightly
- DeltaEcore

Usage:
Create Model and Edit Code for each *.genmodel file
Generate TextResources of all *.cs file (currently not necessary or possible due to a EMFText bug)
